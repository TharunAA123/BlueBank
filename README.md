Blue Bank is a fictional bank in USA that has a loan department which is currently understaffed.
They supply loans to individuals and donâ€™t have much reporting on how risky these
borrowers are.

Using Pandas and NumPy in Python the initial loan JSON file is cleansed. Initial analysis is also done using Matplotlib, and a CSV file comprising cleansed data is generated as well.

This CSV file is extracted using Tableau and a dashboard in created involving analysis of loans, comparing it with FICO scores, annual income, interest rates, level of risk and many other aspects.
